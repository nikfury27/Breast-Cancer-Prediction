# 📌 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📖 Introduction  
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer based on diagnostic data.  

⚠ **Disclaimer:** This model achieves 90% accuracy but should not be used as a replacement for professional medical diagnosis. **Always consult a qualified doctor for confirmation and treatment.**

## 📊 Dataset  
The model is trained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data"> **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set** </a>, which contains features such as:  
✔️ Mean radius, texture, and perimeter  
✔️ Mean smoothness and compactness  
✔️ Mean symmetry and fractal dimension  

The target variable classifies cases as **Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous).**
